Feature: User Interface: The system shall ensure users with Randomize rights can execute record randomization.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0100. User without randomize rights cannot randomize record. 
 
Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0200. User with randomize rights can randomize record.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0300. Record?s randomized value matches allocation table.  C.3.30.1100.0400 User with randomize rights cannot modify randomized record.

Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
