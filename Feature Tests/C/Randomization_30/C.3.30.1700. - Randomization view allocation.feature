Feature: Project Interface Administrator Access: The system shall support administrator-only access to the randomization module's View Allocation Table page.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1700.0100. Admin accesses View Allocation Table page.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1700.0200. User with dashboard rights cannot access View Allocation Table.

Given The above functional requirement has not been written and tested, this functional requirement fail.
Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
