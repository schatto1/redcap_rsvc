Feature: B.2.10.0400. User Interface: The system shall provide the ability to restrict a user who has been assigned to a DAG to: (data they entered | data entered by any member of the same DAG | files uploaded in the File Repository)

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Access Groups is functioning as expected
