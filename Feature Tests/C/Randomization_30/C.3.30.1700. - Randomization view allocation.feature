Feature: Project Interface Administrator Access: The system shall support administrator-only access to the randomization module's View Allocation Table page.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1700.0100. Admin accesses View Allocation Table page.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1700.0200. User with dashboard rights cannot access View Allocation Table.
