Feature: Data Comparison Tool / DDE Module: The system shall assign Reviewer rights to all users not designated as data entry person 1 or 2.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that the system allows non-data entry users to be assigned Reviewer rights when using the double data entry module.

  Scenario: D.4.17.400.100 Assign Reviewer rights to non-data entry users
    #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "D.4.17.400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "CTSIBMICCanonicalProject.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    And I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the "Disable" button labeled "Use surveys in this project?" in the "Main project settings" section 
    And I click on the button labeled "Disable" in the dialog box 
    And I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I see Project status: "Production"
