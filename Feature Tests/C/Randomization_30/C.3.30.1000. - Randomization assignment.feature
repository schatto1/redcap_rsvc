Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the sequential assignment of allocation table entries to participants based on stratification.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1000.100: The system shall prevent uploading an allocation table that lacks sequential assignment.

Scenario: C.3.30.1000.200: The system shall assign the next available allocation entry sequentially to each new record.

Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
