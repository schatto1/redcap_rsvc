Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to download two versions of a data import template formatted as a CSV file, one to accommodate records in rows and one to accommodate records in columns.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.16.0100.100 data import template
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "B.3.16.0100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.16.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"
    And I should see the text "The project has been successfully moved to production status."

    #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
    ##ACTION Data Import Template (with records in rows)
    When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
    Then I should see a link labeled "Download your Data Import Template"
    And I click on the link labeled "Download your Data Import Template" to download a file
