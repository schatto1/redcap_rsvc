Feature: User Interface: The system shall ensure users with Randomization Setup rights lock randomization models and allocation table while in production mode.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.0900.0100. Normal user cannot modify setup in production.  C.3.30.0900.0200. Admin user unable to revert project to development. 

Scenario:  C.3.30.0900.0300. Admin cannot modify setup in production.  C.3.30.0900.0400. Admin can download existing allocation table in production.  C.3.30.0900.0500. Admin cannot modify existing allocation table in production.  

Scenario: C.3.30.0900.0600. Admin can upload additional allocations to existing table in production.

Given The above functional requirement has not been written and tested, this functional requirement fail.
Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
