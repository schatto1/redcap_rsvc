Feature: User Interface: The system shall allow for exporting every field in a database.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that export data is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.5.21.0300.100 Export all fields
    # #SETUP
    # Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    # And I create a new project named "B.5.21.0300.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_5.21.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    # #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
    # ##ACTION: export CSV and confirm column
    # When I click on the link labeled "Data Exports, Reports, and Stats"
    # Then I should see a table row containing the following values in the reports table:
    #   | A | All data (all records and fields) |

    # Given I click on the button labeled "Export Data"
    # And I click on the radio labeled "CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)" in the dialog box
    # And I click on the button labeled "Export Data" in the dialog box
    # Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Data export was successful!"

    # Given I click on the download icons to receive the files for the "CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)" format in the dialog box

    # ##VERIFY:
    # Then I should have a "csv" file that contains the headings below
    #   | record_id | redcap_repeat_instrument | redcap_repeat_instance | redcap_data_access_group | redcap_survey_identifier | data_types_timestamp | ptname | textbox | radio | notesbox | identifier | identifier_2 | date_ymd | datetime_ymd_hmss | data_types_complete |
    # #Manual: Close the report
    # And I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box
#END
