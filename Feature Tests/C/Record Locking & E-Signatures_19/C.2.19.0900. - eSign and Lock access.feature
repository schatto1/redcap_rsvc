Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to limit access to the Record Locking Customization module through user rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Record locking and E-signatures is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.2.19.900.100 Enable user rights for Record Locking Customization module

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "C.2.19.900.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the link labeled "Test_User1"
        And I click on the button labeled "Edit user privileges"
        Then I should see "Editing existing user "test_user1""

        When I click on the checkbox for the field labeled "Record Locking Customization"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Locking / Unlocking with E-signature authority" for the field labeled "Lock / Unlock Records (instrument level)"
        And I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box
        And I click on the checkbox for the field labeled "Lock/Unlock *Entire* Records (record level)"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save changes"
        Then I should see "User "test_user1" was successfully edited"

        ##VERIFY_LOG
        When I click on the link labeled "Logging"
        Then I should see a table header and rows including the following values in the logging table:

            | test_user1 | Update user test_user1 | user = 'test_user1'                     |
