Feature: Project Interface Administrator Access: The system shall support the administrator role's ability to perform the following actions with specifying the reason on the randomization module allocation table: perform edit target field, edit target allocation, manual randomization, and make sequence unavailable.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0100. Admin can edit target field with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0200. Admin can edit target alternative with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0300. Admin can manually randomize a record with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0400. Admin can mark a sequence as unavailable with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0500. Admin can restore allocation with reason.

Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
