Feature:  C.3.24.0405. User Interface: The system shall support the e-Consent Framework to automatically enable a read-only PDF Snapshot trigger that will save a PDF copy of the survey response into the project's File Repository. This functionality must include support for single forms, repeatable forms, and surveys across multiple arms in both classic and longitudinal projects.
