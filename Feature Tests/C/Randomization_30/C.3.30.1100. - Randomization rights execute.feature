Feature: User Interface: The system shall ensure users with Randomize rights can execute record randomization.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0100. User without randomize rights cannot randomize record. 
 
Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0200. User with randomize rights can randomize record.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1100.0300. Record?s randomized value matches allocation table.  C.3.30.1100.0400 User with randomize rights cannot modify randomized record.
