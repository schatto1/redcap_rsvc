Feature: User Interface: The system shall restrict users to randomizing records only within their assigned DAG, in accordance with system-wide access controls.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected


#SETUP project with no randomization enabled - "C.3.30 AllRandOptions.xml"
Scenario:
Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
And I create a new project named "C.3.30.0600" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "C.3.30 AllRandOptions.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

#SETUP Login to Test User 2
Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User2"
And I click "My Projects" on the menu bar
And I click the link labeled "C.3.30.0600"

Scenario: C.3.30.0600.0100. Users within a DAG can randomize records only within their assigned DAG, ensuring they cannot view or randomize records outside their group.  


Scenario: #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT C.3.30.0600.0100. Users within a DAG can randomize records only within their assigned DAG, ensuring they cannot view or randomize records outside their group.
#Users in a DAG can randomize records in their DAG
When I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
And I click the button "Add new record"
And I click the bubble for the row labeled "Randomization" on the column labeled "Status" 
And I click on the button labeled "Randomize" for the field labeled "Stratified by DAG Randomization"
Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Below you may perform randomization for Record ID "1-1" on the field Stratified by DAG Randomization (dag_rand)"
And I click on the button labeled "Randomize"
Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Record ID "1-1" was randomized for the field "Randomization group" and assigned the value "Group 1"(1)" 
And I click on the button labeled "Close"
And  I should see the radio field labeled "Stratified by DAG Randomization" with the option "Group 1" selected 
And I should see "Already Randomized" near the radio field labeled "Stratified by DAG Randomization"

#Users in a DAG can view randomization in their DAG
When I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
And I select "1" on the dropdown field labeled "Choose an existing Record ID"
And I click the bubble for the row labeled "Randomization" on the column labeled "Status"
Then I should see "Drug A" in the data entry form field "Randomization Group" 
And I should see "1" in the data entry form field "Blinded randomization" 
And I should see "Group 1" in the data entry form field "Automatic Randomization" 

#Users in a DAG cannot view or randomize outside their DAG
When I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
And I click on the dropdown field labeled "Choose an existing Record ID"
Then I should see the radio field labeled "Choose an existing Record ID" with the options below
"1"
"1-1"
And I should see the radio field labeled "Choose an existing Record ID" WITHOUT the options below
"2"
"3"
"4"
"5"


Scenario: C.3.30.0600.0200. The randomization model shall support stratification by DAG, allowing independent randomization assignments within each DAG.

Scenario: #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT C.3.30.0600.0200: The randomization model shall support stratification by DAG, allowing independent randomization assignments within each DAG.
#Randomize a second record to DAG 1 (Group 2 is expected)
