Feature: Informed Consent Elements: Compliance with the requirements in Part 11 is meant to prevent fraudulent use. Therefore, the regulations found at 21 CFR part 11 require that an organization verify an individual's identity before it establishes, assigns, certifies, or otherwise sanctions an individual's electronic signature or any element of such electronic signature (see 21 CFR 11.100(b)). 

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that the system confirms electronic identification when signing electronically.
