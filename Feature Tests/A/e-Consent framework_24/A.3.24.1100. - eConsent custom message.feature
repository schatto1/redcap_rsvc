    As a REDCap end user

        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "Modules/Services Configuration"
        Then I should see "e-Consent Framework"

        When I enter "My custom message" into the textarea field labeled "Custom message for e-Consent Framework settings"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        Then I should see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"

        #SETUP
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "A.3.24.1100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "24EConsentNoSetup.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
