Feature: User Interface: The system shall support an audit trail showing who randomized the record and the date-time of randomization.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1200.0100. Logging of record?s randomization includes user and timestamp.  


Scenario: C.3.30.1200.0200. Users with logging privileges and without randomization privileges will not see record?s randomized values.

Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
