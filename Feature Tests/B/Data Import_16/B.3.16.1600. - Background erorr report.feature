Feature: User Interface: The system shall report background process data import errors.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

    Scenario: in B.3.16.1600.100 Report Errors with Background Data Import
        #REDUNDANT Tested in B.3.16.1400
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.16.1600.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "BigDataTestProject.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        Given I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "Project status: Production"

        Given I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
        When I click on the dropdown labeled "Import as background process"
        And I upload the file labeled "BigDataTestProjectbadDATA.csv"
        And I click on the button labeled "Upload"
        And I click the button labeled "Yes, use background process"
        And I click the button labeled "Confirm"
        And I click on the button labeled "Upload"
        Then I should see "Your file is currently being uploaded. Please wait"
        ##M this may take several minutes

        Given I Click on the "Record Status Dashboard"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the table:
            | Record ID | Form 1 |
            | 1         |        |

            | 6         |        |
        And I should see all records are in an unverified status
