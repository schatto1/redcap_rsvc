Feature: User Interface: The system shall ensure users with Randomization Setup can create or modify the automatic triggering options: Manual, Users with Randomize permission, all users (including survey).
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: 

Scenario: C.3.30.0800.0100. Manual only, using Randomize button (default)  

Scenario: C.3.30.0800.0200. Trigger logic, for users with Randomize permissions only  

Scenario: C.3.30.0800.0300 Trigger logic, for all users based on form  

Scenario: C.3.30.0800.0400 Trigger logic, for all users based on survey  C.3.30.0800.0500 Modify trigger while in production

Given The above functional requirement has not been written and tested, this functional requirement fail.
Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
