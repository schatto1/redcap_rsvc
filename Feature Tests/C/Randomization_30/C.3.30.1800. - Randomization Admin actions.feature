Feature: Project Interface Administrator Access: The system shall support the administrator role's ability to perform the following actions with specifying the reason on the randomization module allocation table: perform edit target field, edit target allocation, manual randomization, and make sequence unavailable.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0100. Admin can edit target field with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0200. Admin can edit target alternative with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0300. Admin can manually randomize a record with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0400. Admin can mark a sequence as unavailable with reason.  

Scenario: C.3.30.1800.0500. Admin can restore allocation with reason.

Given The above functional requirement has not been written and tested, this functional requirement fail.
Given The above scenarios are completed before removing this line, which causes this feature to correctly fail automation until it is complete
