Feature: EIC Approval and Versioning: For those studies/projects (vulnerable populations or pediatric studies, for example) where a second or multiple consent signatures may be required, EIC will allow for adding a minimum of 2 (two) signatures.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that the system allows for multiple consent signatures per record.

  #This feature test is REDUNDANT and can be viewed in Feature: D.100.2.0500.: The System shall allow the approved version of EIC will be made available for use on the project/study.
  #Scenario: D.100.2.0500.100 - DOIC.
