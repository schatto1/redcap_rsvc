    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.16.1100.100 Data import of modified record limited by user rights with edit rights
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.16.1100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        ##ACTION: Import data
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
        And I upload a "csv" format file located at "import_files/B3161200100_ACCURATE.csv", by clicking the button near "Select your CSV data file" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload File" to upload the file
        When I click on the button labeled "Import Data"
        Then I should see "Import Successful!"

    Scenario: B.3.16.1100.200 Data import of modified record limited by user rights without edit rights

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: Add User with Basic custom rights

        And I enter "Test_User1" into the input field labeled "Add with custom rights"
        And I click on the button labeled "Add with custom rights"
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Adding new user"

        When I uncheck the User Right named "Data Import Tool"
        And I uncheck the User Right named "Logging"
        And I click on the button labeled "Add user"

        ##VERIFY_LOG: Verify Update user rights

            | test_admin | Add User | Test_User1                              |
            
        Given I logout

        And I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "B.3.16.1100.100"
