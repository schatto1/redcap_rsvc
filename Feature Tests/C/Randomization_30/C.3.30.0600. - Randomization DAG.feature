Feature: User Interface: The system shall restrict users to randomizing records only within their assigned DAG, in accordance with system-wide access controls.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

  Scenario: #SETUP project with no randomization enabled - "C.3.30 AllRandOptions.xml"
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "C.3.30.0600" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "C.3.30 AllRandOptions.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    And I click on the link labeled "Test User1"
    And I click on the button labeled "Edit User Privileges"
    And I check the User Right named "Data Access Groups"
    And I check the User Right named "Setup"
    And I check the User Right named "Dashboard"
    And I check the User Right named "Randomize"
    And I save changes within the context of User Rights
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
      | Role name | Username   | Data Access Group |
      | —         | test_user1 |                   |

  Scenario: #SETUP Randomization User Rights User 2
    When I enter "Test_User2" into the input field labeled "Add with custom rights"
    And I click on the button labeled "Add with custom rights"
    And I check the User Right named "Randomize"
    And I save changes within the context of User Rights
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
      | Role name | Username   | Data Access Group |
      | —         | test_user1 |                   |

  Scenario: #SETUP Upload randomization
    When I click on the link labeled "Randomization"
    And I click on the icon in the column labeled "Setup" in the row labeled "dag_rand"
