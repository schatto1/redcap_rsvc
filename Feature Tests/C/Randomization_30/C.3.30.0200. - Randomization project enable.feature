Feature: C.3.30.0200 User Interface: The system shall allow enabling/disabling Randomization at the project level.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

  Scenario: Randomization enabled
    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test User1"
    And I create a new project named "C.3.30.0200.0100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "cdisc_files/Project 3.30 norand.REDCap.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
    And I click on the button labeled "Enable" in the "Randomization module" row in the "Enable optional modules and customizations" section
    ##VERIFY C.3.30.0200.0100. Enabling adds randomization module to project setup
    ##VERIFY C.3.30.0200.0200. Enabling adds randomization module to application box
    Then I should see a button labeled "Disable" in the "Randomization module" row in the "Enable optional modules and customizations" section
    And I should see "Set up a randomization model"
  #While the "Set up a randomization model" button is visible, it will be disabled (greyed out).

  Scenario: ##VERIFY_log Randomization at project level enabled recorded in logging table
    When I click on the link labeled "Logging"
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the logging table:
      | Time / Date      | Username   | Action        | List of Data Changes OR Fields Exported |
      | mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm | test_user1 | Manage/Design | Modify project settings                 |

  Scenario: C.3.30.0200.0300. Enabling adds randomization module options Setup, Dashboard, and Randomize to user rights privilege setup page.
    When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
    ##VERIFY
