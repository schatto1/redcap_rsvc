    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.16.1400.100 Background Data Import
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.16.1400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "BigDataTestProject.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        Given I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        Given I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
        When I select "Import as background process (better for large data sets)" on the dropdown field labeled "Choose an import option"
        And I upload a "csv" format file located at "import_files/BigDataTestProjectbadDATA.csv", by clicking the button near "Select your CSV data file" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload File" to upload the file
        And I should see "File was uploaded and will be processed soon"
        And I click on the button labeled "Close"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Status     | Original Filename              | Records Provided                  |
            | Queued     | BigDataTestProjectbadDATA.csv  | 75 |
        # Wait for import batch 1
        And I wait for background processes to finish
        # Wait for import batch 2
        And I wait for background processes to finish
        #Manual: this may take several minutes

        When I click on the button labeled "View details"
        And I click on the button labeled "Download list of all errors"
        Then I should see the latest downloaded "csv" file containing the headings and rows below
            | Record | "Variable Name" | Value          | "Error Message"                                                                                                   |
            | 2      | field_1         | "not a number" | "The value you provided could not be validated because it does not follow the expected format. Please try again." |
            | 4      | field_2         | 3              | "The value is not a valid category for field_2"                                                                   |
            | 7      | field_1         | 99-3           | "The value you provided could not be validated because it does not follow the expected format. Please try again." |

        And I should see the "Unverified" icon for the "Form 1" instrument for record "1"
        And I should see the "Unverified" icon for the "Form 1" instrument for record "50"
