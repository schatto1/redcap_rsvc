Password maintained as a directory account controlled by systems CHPC administartors and BMIC Director of Operations. Only REDCap administrators and CHPC staff have permissions to write to this directory. Sub directories in proj_redcap are used to store dev/test/prod for daily database dumps. Subdirectories of dev/test/prod of the project_redcap_vault are used for the Part 11 sftp vault document copies.
FRS: The backup storage location will have limited access only to administrators of the CHPC protected environment.
CS: Archival object backup storage for database exports and for virtual machine file systems are provided by local CEPH storage implementation utilizing Amazon S3 API protection standards restricted to CHPC systems administrative staff who control usage of the Access Key and Secret Key to initiate the archival data backup copy. Following the specified Bareos backup schedule.

  As a REDCap administrator
  I want to see that the backup storage location will only have Bareos and System Admin service Account permission.

  Scenario: D.100.1.2000.100 Access permissions for backup storage location
    #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
    #ACTION
    Given I access Box
    And I navigate to the folder "BMIC Operations > REDCap > Part11-Validation > Validation Documentation > Transition to RSVC > Utah Tier D Release > Installation Qualification Testing (IQ) > IQ evidence and documents"
    And I open the file "REDCap Business Risk Assessment Memo - signed.pdf"
    Then I should have a latest downloaded "pdf" file that contains the contrent below:
    ```
    REDCap Business Risk Assessment Memo

    The current user permission verification strategy is gathering permission sets for each administrator within the CHPC group. This strategy is not feasible as the administrators within the CHPC group change periodically, and the permissions set may become obsolete and significantly deviate between subsequent verifications. The proposed mitigation to this business risk is identifying the CHPC group's role in REDCap backup and restoration. CHPC is an independent group tasked to perform REDCap data backup and restore. The CHPC systems administrators function as a core group with full admin access to maintain the storage and compute resources in the protected environment where REDCap resides.

    The following are the policies and procedures followed at the CHPC group's end to perform the backup and restore (if and whenever needed) for production data. Back up functionality is enabled by CHPC systems administrators installing the client software on the REDCap host systems. Restore requests for any part of the filesystem storage is requested to the systems administrator group at CHPC via a service ticket sent to helpdesk@chpc.utah.edu where the request is processed to restore files from the archive backup CEPH (https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/architecture/) object storage and restored to a location accessible to the CTSI REDCap administrators in the protected environment REDCap project file space or restored to a REDCap host where appropriate. Once restored the CTSI REDCap administrators validate and restore the files to the appropriate operational location.
