Feature: Electronic Signature: The system shall require the user to confirm their intent to sign off on a document or data during the initial signing by entering their full electronic identity. For subsequent signings within a continuous signing session (covering multiple documents within a specified time frame), the system shall permit signing additional documents with only one identity component (typically a password), as the user's identity was fully verified during the initial signing. 

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that the system confirms electronic identification when signing multiple documents within a continuous session.
